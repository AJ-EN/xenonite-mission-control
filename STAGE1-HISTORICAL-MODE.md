Everthing is perfect about historical mode.

Now last modification is when the animation is from '1980 -> 2025' is going at that time. center of the map the year digit is changing.

Now i want to replace the year digit and also create the debries counter like if in 1980's debris count will be 5,000 and in 1990's debris count will be 10,000 and so on till 2025 will be 36,000 as real world NASA debris data. change the format like "Tracked Objects: 5,000" change the digit upto 2025.

And when animation complete then smoothly fade and transition to the next page which is STAGE 2.

Do it.
