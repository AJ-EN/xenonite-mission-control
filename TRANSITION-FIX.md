# Transition Fix - Historical Mode to TLE Input

## Issue Found

After the timeline animation completed at 2025, the TLE Input section (Asset Tracking box) was not appearing properly.

## Root Cause

1. The TLE input section had inline `style="display: none"` that wasn't being removed
2. The overlay padding wasn't being restored for Stage 2
3. The transition logic didn't explicitly set `display: block`

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### File: `js/historical-mode.js`

**Changes in `transitionToLiveMode()` function:**

```javascript
// 1. Restore overlay padding for Stage 2 (so header doesn't overlap)
const overlay = document.getElementById("overlay");
if (overlay) {
  overlay.style.paddingTop = "88px";
}

// 2. Show TLE input section with proper display override
const tleSection = document.getElementById("tle-input-section");
if (tleSection) {
  tleSection.classList.remove("hidden");
  tleSection.style.display = "block"; // Override inline style
  // Small delay for smooth transition
  setTimeout(() => {
    tleSection.classList.add("active");
  }, 50);
}
```

## 🎬 Complete Transition Flow (Fixed)

### Stage 1: Historical Mode

- Overlay has `padding-top: 0` (full screen)
- TLE section has `display: none` (completely hidden)
- Historical mode overlay is `z-index: 100` (on top)

### Transition Sequence (at year 2025 or manual trigger)

1. ⏸️ **Stop playback**
2. 🌫️ **Fade out** historical mode (1 second)
3. ✅ **Hide** historical mode (`display: none`)
4. 📍 **Restore** overlay padding (`padding-top: 88px`)
5. 📊 **Show header** (slides in from top)
6. 📦 **Show TLE section**:
   - Remove `.hidden` class
   - Set `display: block` (override inline style)
   - Add `.active` class (triggers fade-in animation)
7. 🧹 **Clean up** historical debris from 3D scene
8. 🎯 **Dispatch** transition event for other modules

### Stage 2: Live Mode (TLE Input)

- Overlay has `padding-top: 88px` (space for header)
- TLE section is `display: block` and `.active` (visible and interactive)
- Header is visible and active

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Automatic Transition

1. Open `index.html`
2. Click **"▶ PLAY TIMELINE"**
3. Wait for year 2025 (or use 4x speed)
4. **Expected Result**:
   - Historical mode fades out
   - Header appears at top
   - "Initialize Asset Tracking" box appears with smooth fade-in
   - All scenario cards are visible and clickable

### Test 2: Manual Inspection

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Start the timeline animation
4. Watch for console message: `"HistoricalMode: Transition complete - TLE section visible"`
5. Inspect the `#tle-input-section` element
6. **Expected State**:
   - `class=""` (no "hidden" class)
   - `class="active"` (added after transition)
   - `style="display: block;"` (inline style override)
   - Element is visible on screen

### Test 3: Visual Verification

After transition completes, you should see:

- ✅ Header at top with "XENONITE MISSION CONTROL"
- ✅ "Initialize Asset Tracking" centered on screen
- ✅ Four scenario cards (ISS, HUBBLE, STARLINK, COSMOS)
- ✅ "OR" divider
- ✅ Custom TLE textarea
- ✅ "INITIALIZE ORBITAL ANALYSIS" button
- ✅ All elements properly spaced and not overlapping header

| **Header**          | Appears               | Appears ✅               |
| **Overlay padding** | 0px (no space) ❌     | 88px (proper spacing) ✅ |

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Why inline `display: none` was needed

- Ensures TLE section is hidden on initial page load
- Prevents flash of content before JavaScript loads
- Provides double-layer hiding (CSS class + inline style)

### Why we override it in JavaScript

- CSS classes alone couldn't override inline styles
- `display: none !important` in `.hidden` class isn't enough
- JavaScript `style.display = "block"` has highest specificity
- This allows CSS transitions to work properly

### Transition Timing

```
0ms:    Historical mode starts fade-out
1000ms: Historical mode fully hidden
1000ms: Overlay padding restored
1000ms: Header appears
1000ms: TLE section display set to block
1050ms: TLE section .active class added (fade-in starts)
1850ms: TLE section fully visible
```

Total transition: **~1.85 seconds**
